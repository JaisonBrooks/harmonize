# Harmonize
Let me ask you, how does your Downloads folder look? Unorganized? Cluttered? or any other folder for that matter. Rather than spending the time to organize it, moving photos to a photos folder and documents to their cooresponding folder, just to have to do it again when it gets cluttered again.

Ladies and Gents, i present you with **Harmonize**

***Harmonize***, is a script that helps organize your photos, videos, music, documents and more. It's flexible INPUT / EXPORT arguments are easy to use and give you the ability to let Harmonize either do the moving and organizing for you or organize where and how you want it to.

!WARNING!
This script is very alpha and could result in overwritten files, script execution errors, bugs, random explosions and more. You have been warned!
